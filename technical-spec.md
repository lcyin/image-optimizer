## Overview  
The Image Optimizer is a web-based application designed to enhance the performance of images by reducing their file size without compromising quality. The application targets web developers, content creators, and businesses that require efficient image handling for their websites and applications. Use case scenarios include optimizing images for e-commerce platforms, blogs, and social media.

## Requirements  

### Functional Requirements  
- **Image Upload:** Users must be able to upload images in various formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF).  
- **Image Optimization:** The system should optimize images by reducing file size while maintaining quality.  
- **Batch Processing:** Users should be able to upload and optimize multiple images simultaneously.  
- **Download Options:** Users must be able to download optimized images in their original format.  
- **User Authentication:** The system should support user registration and login.  

### Non-Functional Requirements  
- **Performance:** The system should optimize images within 5 seconds for a batch of 10 images.  
- **Scalability:** The application should handle up to 100 concurrent users.  
- **Security:** User data must be encrypted, and secure coding practices should be followed.  

### Compliance Standards  
- GDPR for user data protection.  
- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for accessibility.

## System Design  

### High-Level Architecture  
[High-Level Architecture Diagram (Insert diagram here)]

### System Components  
- **Frontend:** A web interface for users to upload and manage images.  
- **Backend:** A Flask-based RESTful API that handles image processing and user management.  
- **Image Processing Service:** A service responsible for optimizing images.

## Technologies Used  

- **Frontend:** React.js  
  - **Reason:** Component-based architecture allows for reusable UI components.  
- **Backend:** Flask  
  - **Reason:** Lightweight framework that is easy to set up and suitable for building RESTful APIs.  
- **Image Processing Library:** Sharp  
  - **Reason:** High-performance image processing capabilities.

## API Specifications  

### Endpoints  

- **POST /api/images/upload**  
  - **Request:** Multipart/form-data with image files.  
  - **Response:** JSON with optimized image URLs.  
  - **Error Codes:** 400 (Bad Request), 500 (Internal Server Error).  

- **GET /api/images/:id**  
  - **Request:** Image ID.  
  - **Response:** JSON with image metadata.  
  - **Error Codes:** 404 (Not Found).  

### Security Measures  
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens for user sessions.  
- **Encryption:** HTTPS for secure data transmission.

## Implementation Details  

### Algorithms and Data Structures  
- **Image Optimization Algorithm:** Uses lossy and lossless compression techniques.  
- **Data Structures:** Arrays for storing image metadata and queues for processing batches.  

### Pseudo-Code Example  
```pseudo
function optimizeImage(image):
    if image.format not in ['jpeg', 'png', 'gif']:
        return error("Unsupported format")
    optimized_image = compress(image)
    return optimized_image

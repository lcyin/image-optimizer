## 1. Introduction
The **Image Optimizer** web-based application is designed to allow graphic designers to upload an image, adjust its quality, and reduce its file size for optimized use. This lightweight tool will leverage **React** for the frontend and **Python Flask** for the backend, with deployment hosted on **AWS EC2**. The application aims to provide a simple, efficient solution for image optimization without unnecessary complexity, focusing solely on the core task of file size reduction.

## 2. Purpose
The purpose of this Requirements Analysis Document is to:  
- Define the functional and non-functional requirements for the Image Optimizer application.  
- Establish the project’s scope and boundaries to ensure alignment with the needs of the internal development team and graphics department.  
- Provide a technical blueprint for developers to implement the system within the specified constraints.  
- Serve as a reference for stakeholders to evaluate the delivered solution against defined criteria.  

This document ensures clarity and focus for the development process, with no specific risks or ambiguities highlighted for mitigation at this stage.

## 3. Scope
The Image Optimizer project includes the following deliverables:  
- A web-based interface for uploading an image, adjusting its quality, reducing its file size, and displaying the result.  
- A backend service to process image optimization requests.  
- Deployment of the application on AWS EC2.  

### Out of Scope
- Persistent storage or saving of optimized images.  
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.  
- User dashboards or reporting tools.  
- Notification systems.  
- Third-party integrations beyond AWS EC2 hosting.

## 4. Functional Requirements
The following section outlines the core functionalities required for the Image Optimizer application, identified with unique requirement codes for traceability.

### 4.1 User Management
- **FR-001:** The system shall allow access to graphic designers without requiring authentication or role-based access control.

### 4.2 Core Features
- **FR-002:** The system shall provide an interface for users to upload an image in standard formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG).  
- **FR-003:** The system shall enable users to adjust the image quality using a configurable parameter (e.g., a slider or numeric input).  
- **FR-004:** The system shall reduce the file size of the uploaded image based on the selected quality setting.  
- **FR-005:** The system shall display the optimized image to the user for review.  

### 4.3 Integration
- No external systems or APIs are required for integration at this stage.

### 4.4 Notifications
- No notification functionality is required.

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements define the system’s operational attributes.

### 5.1 Performance
- **NFR-001:** The system shall support up to 10 concurrent users without specific response time benchmarks.

### 5.2 Security
- **NFR-002:** The system shall comply with basic security standards (e.g., secure data transmission via HTTPS) as applicable to AWS EC2 hosting.  
- No specific compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) are required at this stage.

### 5.3 Usability
- No specific accessibility requirements or device compatibility benchmarks are defined beyond functional operation.

### 5.4 Scalability
- No scalability requirements are specified at this stage.

### 5.5 Reliability
- No uptime percentage is mandated at this stage.

## 6. Stakeholder Analysis
The following stakeholders are involved in the Image Optimizer project:

| Stakeholder          | Role                        | Responsibilities                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Graphics Department  | Project Sponsor & End Users | Define needs and use the application. |
| Internal Dev Team    | System Developers           | Design, implement, and deploy the app. |

No additional stakeholders (e.g., QA teams, third-party vendors) are identified.

---

## 7. Assumptions and Dependencies

### 7.1 Assumptions
- **A-001:** Users (graphic designers) have access to the application via modern web browsers and sufficient internet connectivity.  
- **A-002:** The internal development team is capable of implementing the solution using React and Flask.

### 7.2 Dependencies
- **D-001:** Deployment relies on AWS EC2 infrastructure being available and configured by the development team.  
- No external services or milestones beyond AWS EC2 are specified.

---

## 8. Constraints
- **C-001:** The project must be completed within 1 week (by March 7, 2025).  
- **C-002:** The backend must be developed using Python Flask.  
- **C-003:** The frontend must be developed using React.  
- **C-004:** The system must comply with basic security standards applicable to AWS EC2 hosting (e.g., secure communication).  
- No budget limitations are specified.

---

## 9. Acceptance Criteria
The Image Optimizer application will be deemed acceptable when:  
- **AC-001:** All functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-005) are implemented and operational.  
- **AC-002:** The system achieves a minimum of 70% test coverage across unit and integration tests.  
- **AC-003:** The application is successfully deployed to AWS EC2 and accessible to graphic designers.  
- No additional deliverables (e.g., user guides, training) or specific approval processes are required.
